## 🤖 OpenClaw Skill

Use TuriX via OpenClaw with our published skill on ClawHub:  
https://clawhub.ai/Tongyu-Yan/turix-cua  
This lets OpenClaw call TuriX so it can act as your desktop agent.

Local OpenCLaw skill (macOS): this repo also includes a ready-to-use skill package in `OpenCLaw_TuriX_skill/` (`SKILL.md` + `scripts/run_turix.sh`).  
Copy it into your OpenClaw local skills folder (for example: `clawd/skills/local/turix-mac/`) and follow `OpenCLaw_TuriX_skill/README.md` for setup and permissions.

Local OpenClaw skill (Windows): on branch `multi-agent-windows`, `OpenCLaw_TuriX_skill/` is updated for Windows with `SKILL.md`, `scripts/run_turix.ps1`, and `agents/openai.yaml`.  
This update adds direct dispatch via `turix` (alias `turix-win`) in the current OpenClaw session, plus pre-flight checks in `run_turix.ps1` (required branch `multi-agent-windows`, conda/config validation, and `--dry-run` support).
You can also instruct OpenClaw directly: read `OpenCLaw_TuriX_skill/README.md` first, then install and configure TuriX.

---

## 🧰 MCP for Codex & OpenCode

This repository now includes a local stdio MCP server entrypoint at `mcp_server.py` so MCP-aware tools such as Codex and OpenCode can call TuriX directly.

### Codex

Typical setup:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
codex mcp add turix -- python /path/to/TuriX-CUA/mcp_server.py
```

If you use conda, point Codex at the Python inside the same environment where TuriX is installed.

Recommended first call from Codex:
- `health_check`

Primary tools exposed by this server:
- `run_task`
- `resume_task`
- `get_task_status`
- `cancel_task`
- `get_example_config`
- `health_check`

### OpenCode

This repo also includes a project-local `opencode.json` that points OpenCode at the same MCP server:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "turix": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["python", "mcp_server.py"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

If your TuriX environment uses a different Python executable, update the `command` array accordingly.

The MCP server is intentionally thin: it prepares a temporary config, then launches the existing `examples/main.py` entrypoint with the same Python interpreter.

</p>

For more details, check our [report](https://turix.ai/technical-report/).

## 🚀 Quick‑Start (macOS 15+)

> **We never collect data**—install, grant permissions, and hack away.

> **0. Windows Users**: Switch to the `multi-agent-windows` branch for Windows-specific setup and installation instructions.
>
> ```bash
> git checkout multi-agent-windows
> ```
>
> For the updated OpenClaw Windows local skill package, see `OpenCLaw_TuriX_skill/README.md` in that branch.
>
> **0. Linux Users**: Switch to the `multi-agent-linux` branch for Linux-specific setup and installation instructions.
>
> ```bash
> git checkout multi-agent-linux
> ```
>
> **0. Windows Legacy Users**: For the previous Windows setup, switch to the `windows_legacy` branch.
>
> **0. macOS Legacy Users**: For the previous single-model macOS setup, switch to the `mac_legacy` branch.


### 1. Download the App
For easier usage, [download the app](https://turix.ai/)

Or follow the manual setup below:

### 2. Create a Python 3.12 Environment
Firstly Clone the repository and run:
```bash
conda create -n turix_env python=3.12
conda activate turix_env        # requires conda ≥ 22.9
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Grant macOS Permissions

#### 3.1 Accessibility
1. Open **System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Accessibility**  
2. Click **＋**, then add **Terminal** and **Visual Studio Code** ANY IDE you use
3. If the agent still fails, also add **/usr/bin/python3**

#### 3.2 Safari Automation
1. **Safari ▸ Settings ▸ Advanced** → enable **Show features for web developers**  
2. In the new **Develop** menu, enable  
    * **Allow Remote Automation**  
    * **Allow JavaScript from Apple Events**  

##### Trigger the Permission Dialogs (run once per shell)
```
# macOS Terminal
osascript -e 'tell application "Safari" \
to do JavaScript "alert(\"Triggering accessibility request\")" in document 1'

# VS Code integrated terminal (repeat to grant VS Code)
osascript -e 'tell application "Safari" \
to do JavaScript "alert(\"Triggering accessibility request\")" in document 1'
```

> **Click "Allow" on every dialog** so the agent can drive Safari.

### 4. Configure & Run

#### 4.1 Edit Task Configuration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Task Configuration is Critical**: The quality of your task instructions directly impacts success rate. Clear, specific prompts lead to better automation results.

Copy the template and edit task in `examples/config.json`:

```bash
cp examples/config.example.json examples/config.json
```

```json
{
    "agent": {
         "task": "open system settings, switch to Dark Mode"
    }
}
```

#### 4.2 Edit API Configuration

Get API now with $20 credit from our [official web page](https://turix.ai/api-platform/).
Login to our website and the key is at the bottom.

In this main (multi-agent) branch, you need to set the brain, actor, and memory models. It only supports mac for now. If you enable planning
(`agent.use_plan: true`), you also need to set the planner model.
We strongly recommand you to set the turix-actor model as the actor. The brain can be any VLMs you like, we provide qwen3.5vl in our platform. Gemini-3-pro is tested to be smartest, and Gemini-3-flash is fast and smart enough for most of the tasks.

Edit API in `examples/config.json`:
```json
"brain_llm": {
      "provider": "turix",
      "model_name": "turix-brain",
      "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
      "base_url": "https://turixapi.io/v1"
   },
"actor_llm": {
      "provider": "turix",
      "model_name": "turix-actor",
      "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
      "base_url": "https://turixapi.io/v1"
   },
"memory_llm": {
      "provider": "turix",
      "model_name": "turix-brain",
      "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
      "base_url": "https://turixapi.io/v1"
   },
"planner_llm": {
      "provider": "turix",
      "model_name": "turix-brain",
      "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
      "base_url": "https://turixapi.io/v1"
   }
```

For a local Ollama setup, point each role to your Ollama server:
```json
"brain_llm": {
      "provider": "ollama",
      "model_name": "llama3.2-vision",
      "base_url": "http://localhost:11434"
   },
"actor_llm": {
      "provider": "ollama",
      "model_name": "llama3.2-vision",
      "base_url": "http://localhost:11434"
   },
"memory_llm": {
      "provider": "ollama",
      "model_name": "llama3.2-vision",
      "base_url": "http://localhost:11434"
   },
"planner_llm": {
      "provider": "ollama",
      "model_name": "llama3.2-vision",
      "base_url": "http://localhost:11434"
   }
```

#### 4.3 Configure Custom Models (Optional)

If you want to use other models not defined by the build_llm function in `examples/main.py`, you need to first define it, then setup the config.

examples/main.py:

```
if provider == "name_you_want":
        return ChatOpenAI(
            model="gpt-4.1-mini", api_key=api_key, temperature=0.3
        )
```
Switch between ChatOpenAI, ChatGoogleGenerativeAI, ChatAnthropic, or ChatOllama base on your llm. Also change the model name.

#### 4.4 Skills (Optional)

Skills are lightweight markdown playbooks stored in a single folder (default: `skills/`). Each skill file starts with YAML frontmatter containing `name` and `description`, followed by the instructions. The planner only sees the name + description to select relevant skills; the brain receives the full skill content to guide step goals.
Skills selection requires planning (`agent.use_plan: true`).

Example skill file (`skills/github-web-actions.md`):
```md
---
name: github-web-actions
description: Use when navigating GitHub in a browser (searching repos, starring, etc.).
---
# GitHub Web Actions
- Open GitHub, use the site search, and navigate to the repo page.
- If login is required, ask the user before proceeding.
- Confirm the Star button state before moving on.
```

Enable in `examples/config.json`:
```json
{
  "agent": {
    "use_plan": true,
    "use_skills": true,
    "skills_dir": "skills",
    "skills_max_chars": 4000
  }
}
```

#### 4.5 Start the Agent

```bash
python examples/main.py
```

**Enjoy hands‑free computing 🎉**

#### 4.6 Resume a Terminated Task

To resume a task after an interruption, set a stable `agent_id` and enable `resume` in `examples/config.json`:
```json
{
    "agent": {
         "resume": true,
         "agent_id": "my-task-001"
    }
}
```
Notes:
- Use the same `agent_id` as the run you want to resume.
- Keep the same `task` when resuming.
- Resume only works if prior memory exists at `src/agent/temp_files/<agent_id>/memory.jsonl`.
- To start fresh, set `resume` to `false`, change `agent_id`, or delete `src/agent/temp_files/<agent_id>`.
