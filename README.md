## 🤖 OpenClaw Skill

Use TuriX via OpenClaw with our published skill on ClawHub:  
https://clawhub.ai/Tongyu-Yan/turix-cua  
This lets OpenClaw call TuriX so it can act as your desktop agent.

Local OpenClaw skill (Windows): this branch includes a ready-to-use package in `OpenCLaw_TuriX_skill/` (`SKILL.md`, `scripts/run_turix.ps1`, and `agents/openai.yaml`).  
Copy it into your OpenClaw local skills folder (for example: `clawd/skills/local/turix-windows/`) and follow `OpenCLaw_TuriX_skill/README.md` for setup and permissions.
This update adds direct dispatch via `turix` (alias `turix-win`) in the current OpenClaw session, plus pre-flight checks in `run_turix.ps1` (branch validation, conda/config checks, and `--dry-run` support).
You can also instruct OpenClaw directly: read `OpenCLaw_TuriX_skill/README.md` first, then install and configure TuriX.

## 📊 Model Performance

Our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on desktop automation tasks:
<p align="center">
   <img src="./doc/performance_sum.jpg" width="1600" alt="TuriX performance">
</p>

For more details, check our [report](https://turix.ai/technical-report/).

## 🚀 Quick‑Start (Windows)

> **We never collect data**—install, grant permissions, and hack away.
>
> For OpenClaw local skill installation, read `OpenCLaw_TuriX_skill/README.md` first.

### 1. Download the App
For easier usage, [download the app](https://turix.ai/)

Or follow the manual setup below:

### 2. Create a Python 3.12 Environment
Firstly Clone the repository and run:
```bash
conda create -n turix_env python=3.12
conda activate turix_env        # requires conda ≥ 22.9
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure & Run

#### 3.1 Edit Task Configuration

Edit task in `examples/config.json`:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Task Configuration is Critical**: The quality of your task instructions directly impacts success rate. Clear, specific prompts lead to better automation results.

```json
{
    "agent": {
         "task": "open Chrome, go to github, search for TuriX CUA, enter the TuriX repository, and star this repository. "
    }
}
```
There is no use_ui parameter in the windows version, the state is only a screenshot.

#### 3.2 Edit API Configuration

Get API now with $20 credit from our [official web page](https://turix.ai/api-platform/).
Login to our website and the key is at the bottom.

In this main (multi-agent) branch, you need to set the brain, actor, and memory models. It only supports mac for now. If you enable planning
(`agent.use_plan: true`), you also need to set the planner model.
We strongly recommand you to set the turix-actor model as the actor. The brain can be any VLMs you like, we provide qwen3vl in out platform. Gemini-3-pro is tested to be smartest, and Gemini-3-flash is fast and smart enough for most of the tasks. Since turix-brain model is updating now, we recommend you to use gemini in our API platform.

Edit API in `examples/config.json`:
```json
"brain_llm": {
      "provider": "turix",
      "model_name": "gemini-3-flash-preview",
      "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
      "base_url": "https://turixapi.io/v1"
   },
"actor_llm": {
      "provider": "turix",
      "model_name": "turix-actor",
      "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
      "base_url": "https://turixapi.io/v1"
   },
"memory_llm": {
      "provider": "turix",
      "model_name": "gemini-3-flash-preview",
      "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
      "base_url": "https://turixapi.io/v1"
   },
"planner_llm": {
      "provider": "turix",
      "model_name": "gemini-3-flash-preview",
      "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
      "base_url": "https://turixapi.io/v1"
   }
```

In this multi-agent branch, you need to set the brain, actor, and memory models. If you enable planning
(`agent.use_plan: true`), you also need to set the planner model.
We strongly recommend you set the turix-actor model as the actor. The brain can be any VLM you like.

For a local Ollama setup, point each role to your Ollama server:
```json
"brain_llm": {
      "provider": "ollama",
      "model_name": "llama3.2-vision",
      "base_url": "http://localhost:11434"
   },
"actor_llm": {
      "provider": "ollama",
      "model_name": "llama3.2-vision",
      "base_url": "http://localhost:11434"
   },
"memory_llm": {
      "provider": "ollama",
      "model_name": "llama3.2-vision",
      "base_url": "http://localhost:11434"
   },
"planner_llm": {
      "provider": "ollama",
      "model_name": "llama3.2-vision",
      "base_url": "http://localhost:11434"
   }
```

#### 3.3 Configure Custom Models (Optional)

If you want to use other models not defined by the build_llm function in the main.py, you need to first define it, then setup the config.

main.py:

```
if provider == "name_you_want":
        return ChatOpenAI(
            model="gpt-4.1-mini", api_key=api_key, temperature=0.3
        )
```
Switch between ChatOpenAI, ChatGoogleGenerativeAI, ChatAnthropic, or ChatOllama base on your llm. Also change the model name.

#### 3.4 Skills (Optional)

Skills are lightweight markdown playbooks stored in a single folder (default: `skills/`). Each skill file starts with YAML frontmatter containing `name` and `description`, followed by the instructions. The planner only sees the name + description to select relevant skills; the brain receives the full skill content to guide step goals.
Skills selection requires planning (`agent.use_plan: true`).

Example skill file (`skills/github-web-actions.md`):
```md
---
name: github-web-actions
description: Use when navigating GitHub in a browser (searching repos, starring, etc.).
---
# GitHub Web Actions
- Open GitHub, use the site search, and navigate to the repo page.
- If login is required, ask the user before proceeding.
- Confirm the Star button state before moving on.
```

Enable in `examples/config.json`:
```json
{
  "agent": {
    "use_plan": true,
    "use_skills": true,
    "skills_dir": "skills",
    "skills_max_chars": 4000
  }
}
```

#### 3.5 Start the Agent

```bash
python examples/main.py
```

**Enjoy hands‑free computing 🎉**

#### 3.6 Resume a Terminated Task

To resume a task after an interruption, set a stable `agent_id` and enable `resume` in `examples/config.json`:
```json
{
    "agent": {
         "resume": true,
         "agent_id": "my-task-001"
    }
}
```
Notes:
- Use the same `agent_id` as the run you want to resume.
- Keep the same `task` when resuming.
- Resume only works if prior memory exists at `src/agent/temp_files/<agent_id>/memory.jsonl`.
- To start fresh, set `resume` to `false`, change `agent_id`, or delete `src/agent/temp_files/<agent_id>`.
